## Notes

### Katana-Patches
Using pre-made katana patches will not be supported, since commonly, third-party patches are optimised for the creators gear, which in most cases results in the patch not satisfying the consumers needs.  
However, creation of custom patches is supported, though they will not be exportable, since they're stored in a custom file format (TOML-Format) which will be readable for Katana-Studio.
